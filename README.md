### THIS PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED IT IS A CURRENT WIP

# Mandragora

Mandragora is an educational anti-cheat operating strictly within usermode/ring-3 context. 

The purpose of this project is to help enable new reverse-engineers or game hackers learn how an anti-cheat might work.

The difficulty of this anti-cheat is purposefully weak. Most new hackers will write a cheat for Assault Cube as their first project, this is designed as a follow-up to see if they can think a bit more creatively about the way they most likely accomplished things.

# Usage

Obviously this anti-cheat is open source, however if you are interested in using this, I highly suggest you download the DLL from releases and AVOID looking at the source unless you get very stuck.

As of now the code has not been obfuscated or virtualized whatsoever meaning it's a great opportunity to practice reversing. 

- Download the DLL from the releases tab
- Open Assault Cube and using any injector or even Process Hacker, inject the dll into the game
- Inject your cheat and good luck! The console will let you know if you've been caught.
